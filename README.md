# SNS Mobile Push

Module to make interacting with mobile push notifications for iOS and Android easier. Wraps the Amazon aws-sdk node module. The idea is that you can create an object to represent each Platform Application you plan to use and remove the excess features that aren't needed for Android and iOS applications.

## Installation

```sh
npm install sns-mobile
```

## Setting Up a User for SNS
To use Amazon SNS you need a Secret Access Key and an Access Key Id. Getting these will require you to create a user under the IAM section of AWS and attach a User Policy with the following Policy Document:

*Disclaimer: I'm not an AWS ninja, this configuration may be too liberal but it works!*

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AccessToSNS",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sns:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Simple Code Example for Android
The below example creates an SNS instance for an Android application identified by a PlatformApplicationArn.

```javascript
var SNS = require('sns-mobile'),
    EVENTS = SNS.EVENTS;

var SNS_KEY_ID = process.env['SNS_KEY_ID'],
  SNS_ACCESS_KEY = process.env['SNS_ACCESS_KEY'],
  ANDROID_ARN = process.env['SNS_ANDROID_ARN'];

var androidApp = new SNS({
  platform: SNS.SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.ANDROID,
  region: 'eu-west-1',
  apiVersion: '2010-03-31',
  accessKeyId: SNS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: SNS_ACCESS_KEY,
  platformApplicationArn: ANDROID_ARN,
  //sandbox: true (This is required for targetting (iOS) APNS_SANDBOX only)
});

// Add a user, the endpointArn is their unique id
// endpointArn is required to send messages to the device
androidApp.addUser('some_fake_deviceid_that_i_made_up', JSON.stringify({
  some: 'extra data'
}), function(err, endpointArn) {
  if(err) {
    throw err;
  }

  // Send a simple String or data to the client
  androidApp.sendMessage(endpointArn, 'Hi There!', function(err, messageId) {
    if(err) {
      throw err;
    }

    console.log('Message sent, ID was: ' + messageId);
  });
});
```

## Running Tests

```sh
SNS_KEY_ID="<your_sns_key_id>" SNS_ACCESS_KEY="<your_sns_access_key>" SNS_ANDROID_ARN="arn:aws:sns:..." npm test
```

## Events Emitted
Instances created will emit events as listed below and callbacks should have the shown format. Event strings can be accessed as shown below.

```
var SNS = require('sns-mobile'),
    EVENTS = SNS.EVENTS;

// EVENTS.SENT_MESSAGE
// EVENTS.BROADCAST_END
// EVENTS.BROADCAST_START
// EVENTS.FAILED_SEND
// EVENTS.DELETED_USER
// EVENTS.ADD_USER_FAILED
// EVENTS.ADDED_USER
// EVENTS.ATTRIBUTES_UPDATE_FAILED
// EVENTS.ATTRIBUTES_UPDATED

// EVENTS.DELETE_TOPIC_FAILED
// EVENTS.SUBSCRIBED
// EVENTS.SUBSCRIBE_FAILED
// EVENTS.UNSUBSCRIBED
// EVENTS.UNSUBSCRIBE_FAILED
// EVENTS.PUBLISH_FAILED

  platformApplicationArn: ANDROID_ARN
  // sandbox: true/false (If we're targetting Apple dev/live APNS)
});

myApp.on(EVENTS.ADDED_USER, function(endpointArn, deviceId){

## API

#### SNS(opts)
Expects an object with the following params:
* platform: Supply any of the platforms in SNS.SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS
* region: The Amazon region e.g 'eu-west-1'
* apiVersion: Amazon API version, I have only used '2010-03-31'
* accessKeyId: Amazon user Access Key.
* secretAccessKey: Amazon user Secret Access Key.
* platformApplicationArn: The PlatformApplicationArn for the Platform Application the interface operates on.
* sandbox: Set this to true to target the Apple APNS_SANDBOX environment with messages.

#### SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS
An object containing supported platforms. Available options are:

* SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.ANDROID
* SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.IOS
* SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.KINDLE_FIRE

#### getPlatformApplicationArn()
Returns the platformApplicationArn provided to the constructor.

#### getRegion()
Returns the region being used.

#### getApiVersion()
Returns apiVersion being used.

#### getApplications(callback)
Get all Platform Applications. This will not allow you to interface with other PlatformApplications but may be useful to just get a list of you applications. Callback format callback(err, users)

#### getUser(endpointArn, callback)
Get a user via endpointArn. The callback(err, user) receives an Object containg Attributes for the user and the EndpointArn.

#### getUsers(callback)
Get all users, this could take a while due to a potentially high number of requests required to get each page of users. The callback(err, users) receives an Array containing users.

#### getTopics(callback)
Get all topics by paging through them. The callback(err, topics) receives an Array containing topic objects.

#### getSubscriptions(topicArn, callback)
Get all subscriptions for the topic with the given topicArn by paging through them. The callback(err, subscriptions) receives an Array containing subscription objects.

#### addUser(deviceToken, [data], callback)
Add a device/user to SNS with optional extra data. Callback has format fn(err, endpointArn).

#### createTopic(name, callback)
Create a new topic with the given name. The callback has the format fn(err, topicArn).

#### setAttributes(endpointArn, attributes, callback)
Update an existing endpoint's attributes. Attributes is an object with the following optional properties:

* CustomUserData: <object|string>
* Enabled: <string>
* Token: <string>

Callback has format fn(err, attributes).

#### deleteUser(endpointArn, callback)
Delete a user from SNS. Callback has format callback(err)

#### deleteTopic(topicArn, callback)
Delete the topic with the given topicArn. The callback has the format fn(err).

#### sendMessage(endpointArn, message, callback)
Send a message to a user. The _message_ parameter can be a String, or an Object with the formats below. The callback format is callback(err, messageId).

#### subscribe(endpointArn, topicArn, callback)
Subscribe an endpoint to a topic with the implicit `application` protocol. The callback has the format fn(err, subscriptionArn).

#### unsubscribe(subscriptionArn, callback)
Unsubscribe an endpoint from a topic via the given subscriptionArn. The callback has the format fn(err).

#### subscribeWithProtocol(endpointArn, topicArn, protocol, callback)
Subscribe an endpoint to a topic using a specific protocol such as `email` or `sms`. The callback has the format fn(err, subscriptionArn).

#### publishToTopic(topicArn, message, callback)
Publish a message a topic. The callback has the format fn(err, messageId).
Please note that the message *must* be in the final Amazon SNS format as
specified [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html#mobile-push-send-multiplatform), i.e. it
*must* contain a key called `default` and platform-specific messages *must* already be JSON-stringified. Example:

```json
{
  "default": "Default message which must be present when publishing a message to a topic. Will only be used if a message is not present for one of the notification platforms.",
  "APNS": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\": \"Check out these awesome deals!\",\"url\":\"www.amazon.com\"} }",
  "GCM":"{\"data\":{\"message\":\"Check out these awesome deals!\",\"url\":\"www.amazon.com\"}}"
}
```

You can read about Amazon SNS message formats [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html).

iOS:

```js
{
  aps: {
    alert: message
  }
}
```

Read more about APNS payload [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html).

Android & Kindle Fire:

```js
{
  data: {
    message: message
  }
}
```

Read more about GCM [here](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/c2dm.html) and ADM [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-adm.html).

#### broadcastMessage(message, callback)
Send message to all users. May take some time with large sets of users as it has to page through users. Callback format is callback(err). If a single/mulitple messages fail to send the error will not be propogated/returned to the callback. To catch these errors use the _sendFailed_ event.


## Contributors
Contrinbutions are very much welcome, just submit a PR with updated tests where 
applicable. Current tests run against the actual SNS service, which may not be 
ideal so feel free to mock that out if you like too ;)
